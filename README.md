1. Data Cleaning: Removing/filling null rows. Out of 1000 rows only 5 rows were NULL (0.5% of the data), hence removing those rows didn't affect the results much.
2. Feature Engineering: Generated new coloumns like time of the day, day of the week, month of the year to analyse the trends as to when they vary
